This project uses a BERT-based model to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to various airlines. It classifies tweets into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments using TensorFlow and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

The BERT-based model was fine tuned on the [Twitter Airline Sentiment Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osanseviero/twitter-airline-sentiment)

Input: "The flight was delayed and no explanation was given."
Predicted Sentiment: Negative
